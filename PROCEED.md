1. Create Java classes to represent the entities in your system, such as User, ChatMessage, and ChatBot.
Annotate the classes with Hibernate annotations to map them to database tables.
Define the relationships between entities, such as the one-to-many relationship between User and ChatMessage.
Implement the user interface:

2. Create a Console-based user interface to accept text commands from the user and display output.
Use Java's input/output classes to handle user input and display output in the console.
Implement the persistence layer:

3. Configure Hibernate to connect to the database.
Create DAO (Data Access Object) classes to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the entities.
Use Hibernate APIs, such as SessionFactory and Session, to interact with the database.
Implement methods to save chat messages, retrieve chat history for a user, and perform other necessary operations.
Implement the bot functionality:

4. Create an interface or base class for chat bots.
Implement specific chat bots by extending the base class or implementing the interface.
Define methods to handle different commands or questions and provide appropriate responses.
Consider implementing a BotManager class to manage the available bots and their activation status.
Handle user authentication and authorization:

5. Implement a login system where users can authenticate using their username and password.
Maintain user sessions and associate chat messages with the corresponding user.
Ensure that only authenticated users can access the chat functionality.
Load and activate bots dynamically:

6. Provide an API or interface for developers to add new chat bots to the system.
Allow developers to compile and deploy their bots independently.
Implement a mechanism to load the available bots dynamically during system startup.
Allow users to view the list of available bots and activate or deactivate them as desired.
Store chat messages in the database:

7. Use Hibernate's persistence capabilities to save chat messages in the database.
Define appropriate mappings and relationships between entities to store the chat history.
Consider implementing a mechanism to limit the number of chat messages retrieved per user to a maximum of 100.
Test the system:

8. Write unit tests to verify the functionality of different components, such as user authentication, chat message storage, and bot responses.
Test the system with different scenarios and edge cases to ensure its robustness.
